# A-B-testing-results-analysis-using-R
This dataset contains information collected by the results of A/B testing of a company’s website concerning the number of conversions on their website in different countries. We have two datasets named “ab_data” and “countries”. These two datasets have information on 7 variables/attributes on 2,94,478 observations. The objective of this analysis is to find which page works better in the sense of conversion and also to find which page works better country-wise i.e. to suggest if we should replace old_page from new_page or not.
