# A-B-testing-results-analysis-using-R
This dataset contains information collected by results of A/B testing of a company’s website concerning number of conversions on their website in different countries. We have two datasets named “ab_data” and “countries”. These two datasets have information on 7 variables/attributes on 2,94,478 observations. The Objective of this analysis is to find which page works better in sense of conversion and also to find which page works better country wise i.e. to suggest if we should replace old_page from new_page or not.
